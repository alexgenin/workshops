# Slides for various workshops 

This repository contains slides and resources used in various workshops related to 
R or technical topics in Ecology (e.g. computing co-occurrence metrics). 

So far, I gathered material about the following topics: 

* General advice for programming (in R)
* The split-apply-combine strategy with the package plyr 
* Introduction to Git 
* Computing co-occurrence patterns
